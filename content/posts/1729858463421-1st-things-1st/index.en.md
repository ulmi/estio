# ESTIO?

So this is a start of something, a new personal page, but also some sort of notebook of what I do, with **data**, with **geospatial**. What I learn in my homelabing experiences or something I can't shut up about it, or something i learned for future memory, like a Today I Learned (TIL). 

Will force myself to do a weekly, I hope, post, with something useful, or just something...but no pressure.

But you are probably wondering why "Estio" for the name of personal website. Well "Estio" is a portuguese/latin word which means in between, in a period of transition, in between Spring and Autumn, and I sorted feel like that, right now i feel like I'm in my “Estio”!
