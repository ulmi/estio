With over twenty years of experience in forestry engineering, but mainly focused on management, that sent me that the geospatial rabbit hole, specializing in FOSS4G tools. On 2005 try to start GIS FOSS4G startup, and failed, started working in my trade, and on 2012 started another startup with some partners and itâ€™s still going. Right now mainly work in geospatial and land management with an increasing dab of data management. I have a passion for understanding problems and work out innovative solutions so I can leisure or procrastinate longer and better.

Currently,  work in a Portuguese municipality as a forestry engineer, but also as a geospatial consultant and a data engineer, dwelling through out a some of these areas:
+ Forestry and wildfire prevention;
+ GIS;
+ Land management, and Urban Planing;
+ Resource and Infrastructure Management, mainly water and sewage utilities.
