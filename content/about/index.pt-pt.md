Agora em tugues

Currently, I am a principal product manager at Docker, where I focus on improving the lives of developers worldwide. I work closely with engineering teams, business stakeholders, and senior management to define and execute the product vision and strategy. I mentor other PMs, or people that want to get into Product and help them with my experience. Additionally, I am a startup advisor, helping early-stage startups with their product and go-to-market strategies. I enjoy writing and sharing my insights and learnings on product management and development, and I welcome any feedback or discussion on these topics.
